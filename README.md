Animation2Tilemap is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of converting images or animated images into tilemaps
and tilesets, compatible with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and other tile-based game development tools.

## Features

- **Versatile Input Support**: Process Bmp, Gif, Jpeg, Pbm, Png, Tiff, Tga, and WebP formats.
- **Flexible Animation Handling**: Convert animations from folders or multi-frame images.
- **Animated Tileset Generation**: Create animated tilesets from single images or frame folders.
- **Customization Options**: Adjust tile size, transparent color, and frame duration.
- **Tiled Compatibility**: Generate tilesets and tilemaps in various formats (base64, zlib, gzip, csv).
- **Dual Interface**: Utilize both command-line and user-friendly GUI options.

## Motivation

This tool was created to streamline the process of transforming pre-rendered images and animations into efficient,
usable tilemaps and tilesets. Manually slicing large images, manipulating animations, and optimizing tiles can be
time-consuming and error-prone.

The tool aims to solve several key problems:

- Automate the process of slicing images and animations into individual tiles
- Identify and remove duplicate tiles to optimize memory usage
- Convert assets into game engine compatible formats

These features are useful in several scenarios:

- Converting detailed backgrounds into tile-based formats
- Converting character animations into sprite sheets
- Optimize large maps or procedurally generated worlds
