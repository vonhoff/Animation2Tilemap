## Motivation

This tool was created to streamline the process of converting a GIF to a tileset and tilemap. 
Manually slicing each frame, manipulating animations, and optimizing tiles can be
time-consuming and error-prone. 

Animation to Tilemap aims to solve these problems:

- Automate the process of slicing images and animations into individual tiles
- Identify and remove duplicate tiles to optimize memory usage
- Convert assets into game engine compatible formats

They are also useful in these scenarios:

- Converting detailed backgrounds into tile-based formats
- Converting character animations into sprite sheets
- Optimize large maps or procedurally generated worlds
